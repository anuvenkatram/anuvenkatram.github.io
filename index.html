		<p>My name is Anulekha, and I recently graduated from Allegheny College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and minors in Spanish and Economics. Currently, I am involved with the Technical Marketing Track at Startup Institute New York, an 8-week career accelerator that equips career changers and recent graduates with the skills necessary to be a high impact employee at a startup company.</p>
		<p>While a student at Allegheny College, I was one of the founders of the startup, Laughing Buddha Bubble Tea, LLC. Born out of Allegheny College's Entrepreneurship II class, Laughing Buddha Bubble Tea provided its college community with a fun, innovative drink and donated half of its proceeds towards student scholarships. In addition to being a startup founder, I was involved with my campus' interfaith movement, which aimed to bridge the gap between various faith and non-faith organizations through action and dialogue. These experiences made me realize two things: my interest in social entrepreneurship as well as my keen desire to learn.</p>
    <p>As a persistent, creative individual, I am ready to embark on a career that intellectually engages me and pushes me to my limits. I would love to be able to work in an environment where I can continue to learn new things, help my community, work with an awesome team, and have fun.</p>
