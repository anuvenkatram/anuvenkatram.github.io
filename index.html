		<p>A recent graduate of Allegheny College, I am ready to embark on a career that intellectually engages me and pushes me to my limits. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in English with minors in Spanish and Economics.</p>
		<p>Originally from Bangalore, India, I enjoy learning from different cultures, reading books, listening to different types of music, and caring about personal health and fitness.</p>
		<p>As a student at Allegheny College, I served as a leader for three student organizations, worked as a Resident Advisor, and was one of the founding members of the start-up, Laughing Buddha Bubble Teaâ„¢, LLC. I was also recognized for my role in the creation of the Prayer and Meditation Retreat (a centrally located residential building that was converted into a prayer and meditation space for Buddhist, Muslim, and Hindu students) by receiving the Cornerstone Award.</p>
		<p>As a persistent, creative individual, I am committed to working independently and through collaboration. Looking ahead, I am open to any opportunity that gives me the chance to exercise my creativity, complements my qualifications, and gives me industry exposure.</p>   
		<p>Currently, I'm excited to join the Technical Marketing Track at Startup Institute.</p>
