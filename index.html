	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>A recent graduate of Allegheny College, I am ready to embark on a career that intellectually engages me and pushes me to my limits. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in English with minors in Spanish and Economics.</p>
		<p>While a student at Allegheny College, I served as a leader for three student organizations, worked as a Resident Advisor, and was one of the founding members of the start-up, <a href="http://alleghenycampus.com/2012/04/20/bubble-tea-allegheny/">Laughing Buddha Bubble Tea, LLC </a>. I was also recognized for my role in the creation of the <a href="http://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-space/prayer-and-meditation-pam-retreat/">Prayer and Meditation Retreat </a> (a centrally located residential building that was converted into a prayer and meditation space for Buddhist, Muslim, and Hindu students) by receiving the Cornerstone Award.</p>
		<p>As a persistent, creative individual, I am open to any opportunity that gives me the chance to exercise my creativity, build relationships, make an impact on my community, and allows me to continue learning new skills.</p>   
		<p>Currently, I'm excited to be a Technical Marketing student at <a href="http://startupinstitute.com/">Startup Institute </a>.</p>
		<h3>What Am I Looking For?</h3>
		<p>I would love to be able to work in an environment where I can continue to learn new things, help my community (be it on a local, national, or global scale), work with an awesome team, and have fun. Personally, I believe that the best way to work is to have fun doing it!
			<h3> What do I do for fun? <h3>
				<p>In my free time, I'm an avid reader, writer, music enthusiast, and zumba-loving fitness nut. I hope to go skydiving someday.</p>
