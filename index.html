		<p>My name is Anulekha, and I recently graduated from Allegheny College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and minors in Spanish and Economics. As a student at Allegheny College, I was one of the founders of the startup, Laughing Buddha Bubble Tea, LLC. Born out of Allegheny College's Entrepreneurship II class, Laughing Buddha Bubble Tea provided its college community with a fun, innovative drink and donated half of its proceeds towards student scholarships.</p>
        <p>While my college experience got me interested in startups, it wasn't until I came to <a href="http://startupinstitute.com/">Startup Institute</a> that my interest became more focused into a data driven role. After 7 weeks with the Technical Marketing track, I found myself intrigued by HTML, CSS, SEO, SQL, and analytics. Learning how to code my own website and track the behavior of users with Google Analytics helped me realize that I want to use data and transform it unto information that can be used in the decision-making process for companies.</p>
    <p>As a persistent, creative individual, I am ready to embark on a career that intellectually engages me and pushes me to my limits. I would love to be able to work in an environment where I can continue to learn new things, help my community, work with an awesome team, and have fun.</p>
